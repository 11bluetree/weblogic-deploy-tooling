The following list are known issues. The issue may contain a work-around or an associated Issue number.

ISSUE:
   The discoverDomain STDOUT contains many SEVERE messages about cd() and ls() when it is run against a 12.2.1 domain.
   The discover tool navigates through the domain MBeans using wlst to determine which MBeans are present in a
   domain. When it tests an MBean that is not present, the erroneous message is logged by Weblogic WLST.
   There is no 12.2.1 PSU available to address this WLST problem. It is resolved in 12.2.1.1.

ACTION:
   Ignore the following messages logged during discover of a 12.2.1 domain.
